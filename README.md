# Visualization
To look at the model performance and interactively look at what the agent's value neural networks are doing, use the interactive plotter with:
```python serve_dash_plotting.py -p your_local_folder/static/example_output_data/history.csv```

look for the link "Dash is running on http://127.0.0.1:8051/" and open that link in your browser. Use the slider to zoom in on a specific section
